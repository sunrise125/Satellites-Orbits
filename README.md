# Abstract 
Since Jan.1,2009 any computation involving Earth's gravitational field 
should be performed by means of the new precession-nutation model
and this paper presents how to determine the orbital elements
of a satellite being known times and topocentric polar coordinates
from a given location. The position of Intermediate Pole is taken from 
IERS and strongly interpolated to have its parameters precise at each 
time of the three observations.
